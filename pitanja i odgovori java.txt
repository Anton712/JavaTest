1. What are access-modifiers in Java? Explain differences between types of access modifiers.
Access-modifiers define scope of class members accessibility.
Public	   - accessible everywhere
Private    - accessible only within class
Protected  - same as public with exception where in different packages it needs to be accessed through inheritance
Default    - accessible only within package.

2. Explain differences between abstract class and interface.
- Abstract class does not support multiple inheritance while interface does.
- Abstract class contains constructor while interface doesn't. It is called when child class is instantiated.

3. Explain difference between Collection and Collections.
Collection is interface which groups objects in a single unit.  (e.g. Set, List, Queue)
Collections is a class that contains methods which can be performed on Collection (e.g. sort(), max(), shuffle(), etc.)

4. Why is said that Stream is lazy?
Stream and its intermediate operations will not be executed until terminal operation is called.
 
5. Explain 4 aspects of OOP.
Encapsulation 	- Example would be hiding fields as private but having accessor properties as public.
Abstraction	- Defining intention rather than actual implementation.
Inheritance	- Inherit members from another class or interface
Polymorphism	- Often related with inheritance where after class inherits members from another class/interface, by polymorphism we then use those inherited members to perform different tasks
